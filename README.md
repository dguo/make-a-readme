# Make a README

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/68992d1c-36d4-4a84-b177-00c1f64fbcb4/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/make-a-readme/deploys)
[![CI status](https://github.com/dguo/make-a-readme/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dguo/make-a-readme/actions?query=branch%3Amain)

[Make a README](https://makeareadme.com) explains what a README is, what the
benefits are, and what makes for a good README. It also provides an editable
template, with live Markdown rendering.

I hope people who are new to programming will find it useful, but even for
more experienced programmers, I think it's worth evaluating once
in a while if we are doing a good job when it comes to the
[small details](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) that
can matter more than we might think.

Make a README is inspired by [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/).

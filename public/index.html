                <p>
                    A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README">README</a>
                    is a text file that introduces and explains a project. It
                    contains information that is commonly required to understand
                    what the project is about.
                </p>

                <h3 class="title is-4">
                    Why should I make it?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    It's an easy way to answer questions that your audience will
                    likely have regarding how to install and use your project
                    and also how to collaborate with you.

                    Who should make it?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Anyone who is working on a programming project, especially
                    if you want others to use it or contribute.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    Definitely before you show a project to other people or make
                    it public. You might want to get into the habit of making it
                    the <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html">first file you create</a>

                    In the top level directory of the project. This is where
                    someone who is new to your project will start out. Code
                    hosting services such as

                    <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> will also
                    look for your README and display it along with the list of
                    files and directories in your project.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While READMEs can be written in any text file format, the most common one
                    that is used nowadays is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>.
                    It allows you to add some lightweight formatting.
                    You can learn more about it <a href="http://commonmark.org/">here</a>, which also has a
                    helpful <a href="http://commonmark.org/help/">reference guide</a> and an
                    <a href="http://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/">interactive tutorial</a>.
                    Some other formats that you might see are
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_file)">plain text</a>,
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText">reStructuredText</a>

                </p>
                <p>
                    You can use any text editor. There are plugins for many
                    editors (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/atom/markdown-preview">Atom</a>,
                    <a href="https://github.com/jrblevin/markdown-mode">Emacs</a>,

                    that allow you to preview Markdown while you are editing it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can also use a dedicated Markdown editor like
                    <a href="https://typora.io/">Typora</a> or an online one like
                    <a href="https://stackedit.io/editor">StackEdit</a> or
                    <a href="http://dillinger.io/">Dillinger</a>. You can even

                    Suggestions for a good README

                <p>
                    Every project is different, so consider which of these
                    suggestions apply to yours. Also keep in mind that while a
                    README can be too long and detailed, too long is better
                    than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider
                    utilizing
                    <a href="#more-documentation">another form of documentation</a>
                    rather than cutting out information.

                    Make it immediately obvious what your project does at a

                <p>
                    On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey
                    metadata, such as whether or not all the tests
                    are passing for the project. You can use
                    <a href="http://shields.io/">Shields</a>
                    to add some to your README. Many services also have
                    instructions for adding a badge.

                    Let people know what your project can do specifically. If
                    there is an alternative to your project, this is a good
                    place to list differentiating factors.

                <p>
                    Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to
                    include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see
                    GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like
                    <a href="https://github.com/icholy/ttygif">ttygif</a> can
                    help, but check out

                <p>
                    If your project only works in a certain context, it's important
                    to be upfront about its requirements. Otherwise, someone may
                    try to use your project, only to discover that it requires
                    a certain version of a language or a particular operating
                    system.
                </p>

                <h3 class="title is-4">
                    Installation
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way
                    of installing things, such as using
                    <a href="https://yarnpkg.com">Yarn</a>,
                    <a href="https://www.nuget.org/">NuGet</a>, or
                    <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>.
                    However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading
                    your README is a novice and would like more guidance.
                    Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets
                    people to using your project as quickly as possible.

                    Usage
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you
                    can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of
                    usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more
                    sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably
                    include in the README.

                    For people who want to make changes to your project,
                    it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get
                    started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or
                    some environment variables that they need to set. Make these
                    steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to
                    your future self.

                    These steps help to ensure high code
                    quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes
                    inadvertently break something. Having instructions for
                    running tests is especially helpful if it requires external
                    setup, such as starting a
                    <a href="http://www.seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a> server for
                    testing in a browser.

                <p>
                    A README is a crucial but basic way of documenting your project.  While every
                    project should at least have a README, more involved ones can also benefit from a
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki">wiki</a> or a dedicated documentation website.

                <p>
                    Just having a "Contributing" section in your README is a good start.
                    Another approach is to split off your guidelines into their own file
                    (<code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code>). If you use GitHub and have this file,
                    then anyone who creates an issue or opens a pull request
                    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors/">
                        will get a link
                    </a> to it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can also create an
                    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue-template-for-your-repository/">issue template </a>
                    and a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository/">pull request template</a>.
                    These files give your users and collaborators templates to
                    fill in with the information that you'll need to properly
                    respond. This helps to avoid situations like getting very
                    vague issues. Both GitHub and
                    <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/description_templates.html">GitLab</a>
                    will use the templates automatically.

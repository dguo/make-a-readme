                <h3 class="title is-4">What is it?</h3>
                <p>
                    A
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README">README</a> is
                    a text file that introduces and explains a project. It
                    contains information that is commonly required to understand
                    what the project is about.
                </p>

                <h3 class="title is-4">Why should I make it?</h3>
                <p>
                    It's an easy way to answer questions that your audience will
                    likely have regarding how to install and use your project
                    and also how to collaborate with you.
                </p>

                <h3 class="title is-4">Who should make it?</h3>
                <p>
                    Anyone who is working on a programming project, especially
                    if you want others to use it or contribute.
                </p>

                <h3 class="title is-4">When should I make it?</h3>
                <p>
                    Definitely before you show a project to other people or make
                    it public. You might want to get into the habit of making it
                    the
                    <a
                        href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html"

                    >
                    in a new project.
                </p>

                <h3 class="title is-4">Where should I put it?</h3>
                <p>
                    In the top level directory of the project. This is where
                    someone who is new to your project will start out. Code
                    hosting services such as
                    <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>,
                    <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a>, and
                    <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> will also
                    look for your README and display it along with the list of
                    files and directories in your project.
                </p>

                <h3 class="title is-4">How should I make it?</h3>
                <p>
                    While READMEs can be written in any text file format, the
                    most common one that is used nowadays is

                    Suggestions for a good README
                </h2>

                <p>
                    Every project is different, so consider which of these
                    sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template
                    are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in
                    mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too
                    long is better than too short. If you think your README is
                    too long, consider utilizing
                    <a href="#more-documentation"
                        >another form of documentation</a
                    >
                    rather than cutting out information.
                </p>

                    Let people know what your project can do specifically.
                    Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors
                    might be unfamiliar with. A list of <b>Features</b> or a
                    <b>Background</b> subsection can also be added here. If
                    there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place
                    to list differentiating factors.

                <h3 class="title is-4">Badges</h3>
                <p>
                    On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey
                    metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing
                    for the project. You can use
                    <a href="http://shields.io/">Shields</a> to add some to your
                    README. Many services also have instructions for adding a
                    badge.
                </p>

                <h3 class="title is-4">Visuals</h3>
                <p>
                    Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to
                    include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see
                    GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like
                    <a href="https://github.com/icholy/ttygif">ttygif</a> can
                    help, but check out
                    <a href="https://asciinema.org/">Asciinema</a> for a more
                    sophisticated method.
                </p>

                <h3 class="title is-4">Installation</h3>
                <p>
                    Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of
                    installing things, such as using
                    <a href="https://yarnpkg.com">Yarn</a>,
                    <a href="https://www.nuget.org/">NuGet</a>, or
                    <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>. However, consider
                    the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a
                    novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps
                    helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project
                    as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific
                    context like a particular programming language version or
                    operating system or has dependencies that have to be
                    installed manually, also add a
                    <b>Requirements</b> subsection.
                </p>

                <h3 class="title is-4">Usage</h3>
                <p>
                    Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you
                    can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of
                    usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to
                    more sophisticated examples if they are too long to
                    reasonably include in the README.
                </p>

                <h3 class="title is-4">Support</h3>
                <p>
                    Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any
                    combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email
                    address, etc.
                </p>

                <h3 class="title is-4">Roadmap</h3>
                <p>
                    If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good
                    idea to list them in the README.
                </p>

                <h3 class="title is-4">Contributing</h3>
                <p>
                    State if you are open to contributions and what your
                    requirements are for accepting them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For people who want to make changes to your project, it's
                    helpful to have some documentation on how to get started.
                    Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some
                    environment variables that they need to set. Make these
                    steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to
                    your future self.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can also document commands to
                    <a
                        href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8503559/what-is-linting"
                        >lint the code</a
                    >
                    or
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_automation"
                        >run tests</a
                    >. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce
                    the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break
                    something. Having instructions for running tests is
                    especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as
                    starting a
                    <a href="http://www.seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a> server for
                    testing in a browser.

                <h3 class="title is-4">Authors and acknowledgment</h3>
                <p>
                    Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the
                    project.

                <h3 class="title is-4">License</h3>

                <h3 class="title is-4">Project status</h3>
                <p>
                    If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put
                    a note at the top of the README saying that development has
                    slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to
                    fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or
                    owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also
                    make an explicit request for maintainers.

                    A README is a crucial but basic way of documenting your
                    project. While every project should at least have a README,
                    more involved ones can also benefit from a
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki">wiki</a> or a
                    dedicated documentation website.

                <p>
                    Just having a "Contributing" section in your README is a
                    good start. Another approach is to split off your guidelines
                    into their own file (<code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code>). If you
                    use GitHub and have this file, then anyone who creates an
                    issue or opens a pull request
                    <a
                        href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors/"
                    >
                        will get a link
                    </a>
                    to it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can also create an

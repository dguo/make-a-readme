                        Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way
                        of installing things, such as using{" "}

                        <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>. However,
                        consider the possibility that whoever is reading your
                        README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing
                        specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to
                        using your project as quickly as possible. If it only
                        runs in a specific context like a particular programming
                        language version or operating system or has dependencies
                        that have to be installed manually, also add a{" "}
                        <b>Requirements</b> subsection.

                        you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest
                        example of usage that you can demonstrate, while
                        providing links to more sophisticated examples if they
                        are too long to reasonably include in the README.

                        For people who want to make changes to your project,
                        it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get
                        started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run
                        or some environment variables that they need to set.
                        Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also
                        be useful to your future self.

                        Just having a "Contributing" section in your README is a
                        good start. Another approach is to split off your
                        guidelines into their own file (
                        <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code>). If you use GitHub and
                        have this file, then anyone who creates an issue or
                        opens a pull request{" "}
